Fire is the major cause of accidents claiming valuable lives and property. Smoke detectors play an important role in a fire prevention management program. Timely detection of the fireplace is vital for avoiding a serious accident. In this project, a Fire prevention and Smoke detection system is developed. It can sense smoke and the rise in temperature and alert the user by activating the siren and also send commands on the virtual terminal of the android phone through the wifi module. Fire hazards are not uncommon. To avoid injury from fire accidents, smoke detectors are put in high-security places. The hardware used is HomeGateway, Switches, Smoke detectors, Fire sprinklers, Smoke sensor, Wifi Module, and Siren. Software used HomeGateway for mobile applications. These smoke sensors detect smoke because the fire break associated invokes an early alarm. This way, before the fire spreads to different components of the building, people can be evacuated and countermeasures can be done immediately. The detection system operates as a fire detector and smoke detector sensor. In this, we discuss the design and implementation of a smoke detection system using the HomeGateway which operates the entire system.
